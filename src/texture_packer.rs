//! Texture packing.

use ImageSize;

/// A texture packer using a skyline heuristic.
///
/// For offline texture packing, see [texture_packer](https://github.com/pistondevelopers/texture_packer).
///
/// Designed for adding textures one by one to current texture atlas.
/// Packs tiles without backtracking or knowledge about future tiles.
///
/// - Perfect at packing tiles of same size
/// - Good at packing tiles of some unit size
/// - Decent at packing tiles of similar sizes
/// - Can be used with pre-sorted tile sizes for better packing
///
/// Can also be used as storage for textures.
///
/// ### Design
///
/// A skyline is a list of non-hole atlas offsets,
/// used to efficiently determine a good place to put the next tile.
///
/// In this texture packer,
/// only a single skyline is kept track of,
/// since new texture atlases are created by need.
///
/// This texture packer has runtime complexity `O(N^2)` for inserting a new tile,
/// where `N` is the number of points in the skyline.
/// Since `N` is usually a low number, the packing is pretty fast.
///
/// The algorithm was designed by Sven Nilsen (2019) for Piston-Graphics.
